<h2 class="bioH">Biography</h2>

<figcaption>My name is James White, and my Major is Computer Science with a hybrid minor in Art and Design.  My general professional objective is to achieve a job writing code with some company that is not EA or Microsoft. I&#39;m chasing the CS degree for fun code writing, and since EA and Microsoft participate in unsavory business practices I have no desire to work for them, ever.</figcaption></div>
