<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>My name is James White, and my Major is Computer Science with a hybrid minor in Art and Design.  My general professional objective is to achieve a job writing code with some company that is not EA or Microsoft. I&#39;m chasing the CS degree for fun code writing, and since EA and Microsoft participate in unsavory business practices I have no desire to work for them, ever.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I have taken classes that teach code writing, photoshop, and sketching. They have priority in the order that they are listed, a more detailed list can be found below.</p>

<h2>Work/Volunteer/Activity/etc.</h2>

<p>Currently the only work experience I have is mandatory volunteer work for a class I took back in high school.  I also worked very briefly for Cutco Cutlery, but found that it was not the right kind of work for me.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<ul>
<li>Java in JGrasp and a little in Eclipse</li>
<li>C & Unix</li>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li>C# in Visual Studio</li>
<li>Web Design with Github and CodePen</li>
<li>C++ in Visual Studio</li>
</ul>
